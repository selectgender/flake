# Nixos Config
Hello! I tried to make my config as intuitive as possible, if there was
literally *anything* that was confusing to you.. then please file an
issue immediately!
<br />
<br />
I made some custom modules myself like the aesthetics one and the one
in the experimental-neovim directory, so if you write nix code better
than me and want to improve upon it, feel free to file a pull request!
<br />
<br />
I won't be too active in this repo since I have studies to do, but I'll
try to check up on it!
